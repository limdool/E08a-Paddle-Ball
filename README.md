# E08a-Paddle-Ball
Today, I worked on the first Godot exercise. The purpose of this assignment was to create a paddle that can move by a mouse and a ball that bounces off a wall. Before I started working on the assignment, I installed Godot Engine. After downloading Godot Engine, I went to github website and cloned a repository. When I finished cloning, I opened Godot Engine and selected the repository. I changed some of the settings, such as viewport. I changed viewport into 2D because the assignment should be 2D game. After making some changes, I set up a paddle and a ball on the screen. After running the scene, I edited my LICENSE and README.md.
